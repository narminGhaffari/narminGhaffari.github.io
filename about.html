  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with the Else Kröner Fresenius Center for Digital Health at TU Dresden and the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) in Heidelberg, working in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).</p>
  <p>My work bridges academic AI research and real-world clinical applications, particularly in computational pathology and translational oncology. I have led multiple international collaborations, mentored PhD and master’s students, and contributed to high-impact research on topics like weakly supervised learning, biomarker prediction, and explainability in AI.</p>
  <p>I am also passionate about scientific communication and have organized and led several international summer schools and educational programs to promote AI literacy in medicine.</p>
